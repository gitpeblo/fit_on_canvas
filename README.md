=============

Get the stellar mass, radius and age from the Padova interface This code also includes mass and radius calculations using the Torres et al. 2010 calibration.

Create a file 'star' and fill with the parameters: star name, temperature, error in temperature, metallicity, error in metallicity, V magnitude, error in V, parallax, error in parallax. The file 'star' is given as an example. This code will return the mass and radius from the Padova interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/param) in the 'stellar_characterization.dat' file.

In case there is no information on the parallaxes, masses and radii will be calculated using only the calibration. Therefore, the user must specify with a flag

Run in case parallaxes are included:

    python mass_radius_age.py star on 
Run in case parallaxes are not included:

python mass_radius_age.py star off
The user inputs the name of the file.
